## 5.2.224-JuNNeZ (2026-03-06)

### Fixes
- Improved mount-to-combat actionbar transition refresh so cooldown/swipe rendering starts correctly when entering combat from a mounted actionbar state.
- Fixed assisted-highlight option handling so recommendation highlights respect WoW assisted combat highlight toggle state.
- Fixed player absorb display path so hidden absorb bar zero values no longer block valid absorb fallbacks.
- Improved action button handling for morph/replacement spells by resolving effective action spell IDs and forcing action-slot refreshes on cast/charge updates.
- Fixed crystal/orb color source selection so `Default` and `Enhanced Colors` resolve consistently from the selected mode.
- Improved MaxDps compatibility for interrupt recommendations by preserving native MaxDps alpha-driven overlay behavior on Azerite LAB buttons.

### Known Not Working
- Charges not going down in some cases.
- Morphing spells do not always show cooldown during morph transitions (example: Wake of Ashes -> Hammer of Light -> Wake of Ashes).

## 5.2.218-JuNNeZ (2026-03-05)

### Game Version Support
- **Added WoW 12.0.1 support** — Now targets and is compatible with Midnight patch 12.0.1 (120001) and 12.0.0 (120000).

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed ExplorerMode crash** — "attempt to perform arithmetic on local 'min' (a secret number value)" error when checking player mana power. Added secret value guards to prevent arithmetic on WoW 12+ secure values.
- **Fixed BtWQuests compatibility crash** — `SetPortraitToTexture` fallback in compatibility layer no longer calls a nil original API; now safely falls back to `texture:SetTexture(asset)` when needed.
- **Fixed AuraTemplates global lookup crash** — Restored legacy global alias `AzeriteUI` for XML/legacy script compatibility after addon folder renaming.
- **Fixed enemy name visibility regressions** — Nameplate hostile units are no longer misclassified as object plates when `UnitCanAttack/UnitCanAssist` return secret values; improved target/name fallback resolution in unit tag name logic.
- **Fixed player power crystal art alignment defaults** — Updated default widget/frame/threat offsets and crystal sizing so the player power crystal, case, and threat overlays line up correctly out of the box.
- **Fixed debug SafeCall return passthrough** — `SafeCall()` now preserves a fifth return value to avoid truncated data in debug dump helpers.

## 5.2.217-JuNNeZ (2026-03-04)

### Breaking Changes
- **Removed Classic/Vanilla support** — Dropped `AzeriteUI5_JuNNeZ_Edition_Vanilla.toc` and Classic Era compatibility. This edition now targets Retail (Midnight/WoW 12+) only. Classic WoW code removal will follow in future versions.

### CurseForge & Packaging Configuration
- **Added JuNNeZ Edition CurseForge project ID** — Now uses project ID `1477618` to prevent conflicts with original AzeriteUI (ID: 298648).
- **Removed original AzeriteUI identifiers** — Removed original project IDs (`X-Curse-Project-ID: 298648` and `X-Wago-ID: R4N2PZKL`) from both TOC files.
- **Updated addon folder references** — All IconTexture paths now correctly reference `AzeriteUI5_JuNNeZ_Edition` folder name instead of generic `AzeriteUI`.
- **Added edition attribution** — TOC files now include `X-Edition: JuNNeZ Fan Edition - Not affiliated with original AzeriteUI` to clearly identify this as a fan project.
- **Fixed package configuration** — Updated build script and `.pkgmeta` to use correct addon name and removed invalid folder move directives.
- **Improved multi-version support** — GitHub Actions workflow now auto-detects all game versions (Retail, Cata Classic, Classic Era) instead of forcing retail-only.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed nameplate unit names in dungeons** — Hostile enemy names now display on nameplates in dungeon/instance content. Previously, names were only visible when mousing over or in active combat due to overly restrictive visibility logic.

## 5.2.216-JuNNeZ (2026-03-03)

### Demon Hunter Devourer — Soul Fragments Display
- **New soul fragments display** — Devourer DH soul fragments (0–50 stacks) now display as a 10-point combo-point-style system. Each point represents 5 stacks; points light up progressively in a spiral layout matching the rogue combo point aesthetic.
- **4 display modes** — Choose between Alpha, Gradient, Recolor, and Stacked 5-Point (hide empty, bright overflow from bottom) via Options → Unit Frames → Class Power.
- **Show Soul Fragments toggle** — New visibility toggle in Options → Unit Frames → Class Power for Demon Hunter Devourer.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed ActionButton taint** — `ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED` and secret number compare errors caused by Blizzard action button hiding writing secure attributes. Now uses non-destructive hide+reparent only.

### Libraries & Internals
- **Loaded LibEditModeOverride-1.0** — Library was bundled but not loaded. Now available for future Edit Mode integration.
- **Updated LibEditModeOverride-1.0** — Applied upstream CooldownViewer slider fix from commit 39f30e5.

### Known Issues
- **Edit Mode taint errors** — Opening or closing Edit Mode causes multiple taint errors. Investigation ongoing for next version.
- **Mana orb** — Mana orb display is still under investigation for WoW 12.
- **Target castbar crop** — Some non-self target casts may still show incorrect fill behavior; probe bar validation is ongoing.

## 5.2.211-JuNNeZ (2026-03-02)
- **JuNNeZ Edition:** Updated and maintained by JuNNeZ.
- Added power text size slider for player power crystal and mana orb (50-200% scale).
- Fixed Blizzard PVP Match scoreboard pool nil Release spam (preventive guard for 3000+ errors).
- Added secret `/junnez` easter egg command for fun.
- Updated version numbering and credits across all TOC files.

## 5.2.210-Release (2026-03-01)
- Added a target castbar debug probe (`Target.Castbar.TestBar`) to compare timer-driven cast fill behavior against the current fake-fill path.
- Improved target cast runtime fallback handling by probing timer payloads (`GetTimerDuration`) in generic cast sync hooks and preserving live fill on transient pending ticks.
- Fixed `PartyFrames` post-combat callback crash (`LibMoreEvents-1.0.lua:76`) by adding the missing `PartyFrameMod.OnEvent` handler for deferred header updates.
- Improved target cast debug visibility by dumping probe castbar state/source in `/azdebug dump target`.
- Updated development guidance for WoW API tooling and MCP usage (`AGENTS.md`) to reflect current working workflow.

### Known issue (deferred)
- Target castbar crop behavior for some enemy/non-self casts is still under investigation; probe bar output is now the primary validation path.
- Mana orb status remains under active investigation in WoW12 paths.

## 5.2.209-Release (2026-02-18)
- Restored actionbar cooldown swipe/timer progression in combat by returning the cooldown pipeline to the known-good WoW12 path.
- Added release-guard comments in actionbar and cooldown code to reduce risk of future regression during patching.
- Fixed party portrait click targeting reliability (including Brann follower targeting).
- Improved unit frame/tag stability for hostile target/nameplate names and health text updates.
- Removed forced archaeology UI loading path from AzeriteUI to avoid external protected-call taint chains (`Rarity`/`Ace3`) in this environment.
- Fixed oUF health color crash when runtime color data is not a ColorMixin object (`GetRGB` nil safeguard).

### Known issue (deferred)
- Charge tracking for some spells (for example Divine Steed and Judgment) still needs additional WoW12 investigation and is deferred to the next build.
- Manaorb doesn't work still.

## 5.2.208-Release (2026-02-17)
- Improved WoW 12 secret-value stability in core UI update flows.
- Fixed player power visual update reliability (mana orb + crystal behavior).
- Fixed target health and fakefill update flow, including crop/stretch behavior.
- Stabilized target and nameplate health writes under restricted/secret value conditions.
- Improved tooltip/backdrop guard behavior for modern tooltip mixins.
- Restored WoW11 delayed module enable flow for action bars, pet bar, and stance bar.

### Known issue (deferred)
- Charge tracking for some spells (for example Divine Steed and Judgment) still needs additional WoW12 investigation and is deferred to the next build.
